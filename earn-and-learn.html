  <h2 class="block">GET PAID<span> WHILE YOU LEARN </span></h2>
  <p class="emphasis"> Through our business sponsorship program you could be paid up to $1000 to build a website for a small business, start-up or non-profit </p>
  <p> If you have just landed on this page, we run 10 day all-inclusive coding bootcamps in beautiful locations around the world. In just 10 days we take 12 students from all over the world with no previous technical experience and we teach them how to code responsive websites from scratch. We decided that for students who came along without a real project to work on, why not pair them with small businesses so that they could work on a real project and save a little money at the same time. Hence our business sponsorship program was born </p>

  <h2> How it works ... </h2>
  <p class="emphasis"> Basically the business will provide a completed design before the retreat starts and then during the 10 day retreat you would build one of your portfolio pieces for the business. We'll be there to help every step of the way. </p>
  <p> Typically we help students who are already enrolled in our program reach out to their local community and find local businesses who might be a good fit. For the business, this is an opportunity to not only give back to the community and support a students education but also receive a professional quality website at a fraction of the agency cost. </p>
  <p> We're also actively reaching out to the community to find potential business sponsors and help people who might not have been able to afford the investment of the course come along and accelerate their career. </p>
  <p class="emphasis"> We have one sponsorships available right now which is a $1000 sponsorship available for the June 10 session. </p>
  <p> To learn more <a href="mailto:hello@instituteofcode.com" class="button" taget="_blank"> EMAIL US </a> now. </p>
  <p> The June 10 session is normally $2450US, so with a $1000 sponsorship that brings the total price of a ten day all-inclusive bootcamp down to only $1450US excluding flights ... crazy! From August onwards all of our programs will be $2850US+ so this is an incredible opportunity. </p>
