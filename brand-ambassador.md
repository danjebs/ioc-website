##Opportunities Available:

###Brand Ambassadors
Open to anyone, you don’t need a certain number of followers you just need a passion for our brand and to believe in what we do.

As a brand ambassador, you just share the love of IOC with your friends, family and network and in exchange earn rewards.

*1st Referral:* - An IOC Swag Pack with a stainless steel insulated water bottle & branded Moleskin Notebook

*2nd+ Referral:* Earn a $100US commission on every person you refer who signs up for one of our 10 day coding bootcamps.

*Refer 25 people to the program* and earn a full ride scholarship to one of our 10 day coding bootcamps (in addition to the commission you would earn).

Brand Ambassadors also access an *exclusive discount* of $150 off any course for themselves.

###Brand Influencer
Our Brand Influencer position is open to anyone who has referred 10+ people to the IOC family or has significant influence (for example 100,000+ followers on social media).

Brand Influencers earn a $150US commission on all referrals.  Brand Influencers can access exclusive discounts or promotions for their followers, and have the opportunity to do a snapchat ‘takeover’ and drive new followers to their own social media.

*Selected* Brand Influencers may be invited to attend an 10 day coding retreat on a full ride scholarship (aka free of charge) or to attend our 2 day ‘Taste test of IOC’ event in Mexico in August 2016 which will be exclusive to influencers. Generally speaking this is only available to influencers who we build up an ongoing relationship with but just reach out and chat to us if you are interested in this possibility.

## Here is how it Works

1. Apply using the form below.
2. We’ll review your application and get back to you within 48 hours.
3. We’ll provide a link for you to use when promoting Institute of Code that will track all referrals on a 30 day cookie. If you are promoting through Instagram or word of mouth, we also manually ask all applications who referred them and how they heard about us.  

4. At various times, we will provide a value-add to give your friends and followers a little extra incentive. It may be a discount code for 2 free nights accommodation, a flight voucher, discount coupon, etc.
5. At the end of every month we will track all your successful referrals and pay out your commission via paypal or transferwise.  For example, if 10 students enroll using your link in 1 month, you will receive $1000 - $1500 at the end of the month. Woo-hoo!
