![](/uploads/versions/bali_2016-5-1024x681---x----1024-681x---.jpg)Nastasia, the founder of Dame Traveller, joined us on our June 10 retreat in Bali! She wanted to take control of her website and not be so reliant on third parties to run it for her. The following article recaps the time she shared with us and what kind of experience to expect at The IOC!

> "So you want to learn how to code? Well, what if I told you that you could learn this skill in a luxury villa located in beautiful places such as Bali or Mexico instead a dreary florescent lit classroom?
>
> Well good news! The folks over at the Institute of Code have made this dream a reality. I just got back from a 10 day all-inclusive coding retreat with The Institute of Code in Bali and I walked away with not only valuable coding skills but a fresh new perspective, inspiration, motivation and wonderful new friends…"

> "Learning how to code with IOC does not just stop at simply acquiring a technical skill. It goes beyond that. We live in a digital age where we are more connected than ever before. If you’d like to someday live freely like the digital nomads or travel bloggers you follow on social media, coding is the perfect place to start. As a travel blogger, I am able to work remotely from anywhere in the world and learning how to code will help me even more during my ventures because I’ll be in complete control over my online business. Whether you’re interested in travel blogging, web development, entrepreneurship, etc., coding can open up so many new doors to the life that you’ve always dreamed of living."
