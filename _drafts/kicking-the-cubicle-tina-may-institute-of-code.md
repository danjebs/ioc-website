> "Learning to code is an invaluable skill in the 21st century– one that I just recently learned while attending the Institute of Code’s 10-day Bali program. I wanted to know more than the basics, and I wanted to feel empowered and self-sufficient with coding and the website skills I’d long-wanted to learn. In comes Tina!…"

> "I LOVE this time I get to spend really bonding with each group of students. I love sharing actionable strategies on how to be a digital nomad and travel for work, or my experiences freelancing or launching a startup and it’s great having time to sit down and hear from my mentors on the topics they are really passionate about. - Tina May"
