![](/uploads/versions/billboards---x----1000-563x---.jpg)Irene is an international beauty/travel blogger. This article was written after she found us on Instagram and fell in love with our concept. Since writing the piece, she made the decision to join us for our June 23 course - keep an eye up for her follow up VLOGs!

> "Lately, I’ve been thinking about my blog and I realized that as self-reliant as I see myself sometimes.. where would I be without a platform like WordPress? Reality set in. I’ve fallen behind and I am dependent on a third party. If I had to build my blog again from scratch, I wouldn’t be able to. I just don’t have the technical skills to pull it off anymore and the web has changed so much in the past two decades. Then I stumbled across an incredible coding program called Institute of Code…"

> "Let me tell you why this program resonates with me so much, and why I think&nbsp;**we all need to go**. My parents shamed me my entire life for not studying enough or for having too much fun. To them, studies weren’t supposed to be fun and fun was only reserved for summer vacation — when they weren’t shoving SAT books down our throats of course. Institute of Code is a rebel against the philosophy that education has to be a difficult, unenjoyable struggle. In her own words, Tina’s explanation is — “We believe that when people are motivated and inspired, when they have all of their needs catered for and when you remove all the messy distractions of life in creates an environment of accelerated learning”"
