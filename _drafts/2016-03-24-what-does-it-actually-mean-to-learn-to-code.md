Lately we’ve had a few emails pop into inbox saying something along the lines of ‘I love the concept and I’m excited to potentially come along, but just wondering … what does learning to code actually mean?’. It’s a great question, on one code schools like ourselves often assume (incorrectly) is common knowledge.

Coding, put simply, is writing a set of instructions that a computer can understand and then convert into action. There are lots of ‘programming languages’ that you can code in, which each have their own purpose, and just like spoken languages have their own ‘syntax’ (own meaning of words and phrases). Code makes up the backbone of all digital products. Computers can’t understand english, or images or videos, they only understand code. So everything that you see in a digital product, whether it’s this screen right now, or an app on your phone is built in ‘code’.

### If a website were a house - A simple explanation of common front-end programming languages.

Different coding languages have different roles, and I’ll try to explain some of the most common languages here. To use a house metaphor, HTML is your walls and floor and foundation that give the house it’s structure. The HTML determines how many rooms, doors and windows your house will have. The CSS is the everything that makes your house beautiful and unique. It’s the paint on the walls, the height of the ceiling, the position of the windows, the color of the paint and anything that affects the look and feel.

Javascript then is what makes your house interactive, like the spotlight that turns on when you walk past a certain spot, or the garage door that opens when you press a button.

The roles on the web are just the same. HTML determines the structure and order of the website, by telling it for example to include a heading, then some text, then a few images, and a button. It uses ‘divs’ like rooms to separate different sections of the website. The CSS then applies the styling, like the layout, size, color, and font of different elements. Then the javascript adds interactivity to your site, like a slideshow or gallery, social plugins (like our facebook like button at the bottom of the page) or a smooth scroll effect.

### What does a website look like without any CSS?

As a demonstration, here is this blog, side by side - on the left is the website with CSS applied, and on the right is just the HTML on its own (it’s a little trickier to show javascript in a static photo, since it’s all about interaction). Our CSS makes our headings teal, applies our font, and splits the page into a main section and a sidebar, just to name a few.
