It dives deep into our teaching philosophy and why we choose to create our immersive environment for learning.

> "On Sunday morning we woke up to discover a delightful blog post slamming our startup, The Institute of Code calling it ‘The Institute of Unrealistic Expectations’ and arguing that the whole concept of a 10-day coding retreat was utter bullshit.
>
> I wrote a short response on their blog, but as since my comment was not approved, I thought I would share it here as I think their argument is underpinned by a number of myths that need debunking…"

> "Ninety percent of the students who attend our 10-day coding bootcamp aren’t aiming to become full-time developers — they just understand that digital skills are in high demand and can help boost your job prospects and productivity in lots of different roles."

> "It just makes sense when you think about it. We take away all of the mental distractions (cooking, cleaning, commuting, miscellaneous chores) so that people can focus on just one thing — learning to code, surrounded by other professionals, entrepreneurs and creatives in an environment that inspires them."
