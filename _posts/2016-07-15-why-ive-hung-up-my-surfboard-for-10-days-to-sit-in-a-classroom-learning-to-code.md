first-content: "'<p> Chantell is an author, marketing/advertising consultant and entrepreneur and came to our June 10 course to help take control of her online presence. Chantell wrote this piece around the reasons she knew it was so important for her to learn to code as a business owner. </p> <p> Her favourite part? That she could learn a skill so valuable to being an entrepreneur in such a supportive, immersive environment. When we weren't coding we were exploring the rice paddies, surfing and watching the sunset over the ocean and just hanging out with a group of inspiring entrepreneurs and creatives from all over the world. </p>"

"Instead of surfing, chilling on the beach and seeing friends whenever I want, for 10 days I’ve voluntarily taken that freedom away from myself. I‘ve packed up a little bag, left my beautiful home and surfboard behind [\*sob] to be stuck in a classroom learning to code!"

"And I’m doing this even though learning to code sounds to me a little bit like optionally choosing to go back to school and study mathematics (which I can assure you was not something I excelled at or found even remotely interesting the first time round). But I’m still doing it. And&nbsp;**if you run your own business but don’t have a huge start-up fund backing you up, you should be too."**

"There are certain skills that are essential for running your own business like having enough emotional intelligence to work well with clients, understanding marketing, and&nbsp;***a basic understanding of how to code…"***

> "I mention making use of as many marketing opportunities as possible too since you’ll find that time-and-time again online platforms, via which you may want to promote your company or products, will require basic code to be used in order to make the listing look good. There won’t be a magic bold button like in Microsoft Word to highlight key points and you certainly won’t be able to make key points drop down in a list of any sort without inputting code. If you’re just setting up your business you need to learn these basics now."
