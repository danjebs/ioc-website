That's why we're super excited to announce we'll be launching special partnerships with startups, charities and other companies. These partnerships will provide our students with ongoing internships and job opportunities across an array of industries and fields after they've completed their course.&nbsp;

The first company we've partnered with is startup Mailbird.

Mailbird is an email management client that makes lives easier by unifying the most popular communication apps into the one place. They have been featured in Forbes, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, The Huffington Post, The Next Web, CNBC, CNN, Bloomberg, PC World and IT World.&nbsp;

Mailbird was the first email client to integrate speed reading, and have been awarded the best email client for Gmail and Windows. They were also nominated best startup of the day by the Microsoft Bizspark program.

A few weeks ago, we met CEO, Andrea Loubier in Bali.

Andrea is one of most recognised female entrepreneurs and thought-leaders in South East Asia, having built Mailbird into a global product with an internationally distributed team. A warm and energetic person, it was great to hear she shared our passion for empowering women in particular to start and lead businesses.&nbsp;

Mailbird will be accepting internships from the entire spectrum of the company, from development to marketing. That means once students graduate from our course, they'll have the chance to work towards these amazing roles.

We're really thrilled to be able to work with these amazing companies like Mailbird, so we can continue supporting our community, opening more gates and illuminating more paths.&nbsp;
