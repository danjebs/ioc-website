intro: "Flashback a year ago and you probably couldn’t pay me to learn to code. The task seemed overwhelming, impossible to tackle and frankly boring – especially when I envisioned my options: trying to go it alone with online courses or Youtube tutorials or signing up for a physical\_course that I’d have to take up in my free time on top of my full-time job.\_No, thank you."
first-content: 'But in reality, there was a need for me to learn. I was trying to launch this travel blog and running into constant small changes that I wanted to make on my own rather than having to dial a developer for each minor tweak. And I was on the hunt for skills that could get me on my way to the digital nomad lifestyle.'
