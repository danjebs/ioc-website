She will be joined by 6 other mentors with expertise in content strategy, photography, coding, and design.<br /><br />The difference between our blog mentorship retreat and other blog courses is our team&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to your education. Working one-on-one daily with a team of experts will ensure you have a deep understanding of blogging, a clear strategy on how to effectively tell your story and a plan on how to better connect with your audience.</p>
