  <div class="white-box">
    <p> "I completed Kiersten’s mentorship program when I was first started my blog, and it was the smartest decision I could have made as an aspiring entrepreneur. Kiersten helped me develop my brand into what it is today, and I attribute much of my success to the advice I received from her at the very beginning. When I started with her I had no clue what I was doing. She broke it down into a series of actionable steps, and taught me exactly what I needed to know about blogging, social media, graphic design, and running an online business. Now I’m proud to say that over 100,000 people visit my website every month, and my blog has grown into a financially viable online business with a small team of people behind it." </p>
